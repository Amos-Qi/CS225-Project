### Conclusion
Our leading question for this project is How to get and visualize the Gnutella peer-to-peer graph/network with the most important host list. Now, with the functions and algorithms we implemented, we can successfully find the most important point from a graph database and visualize it. During this process, we have encountered two problems like our original way to determine the most important point is too slow, so we change our algorithm and implement it in a different way. Another problem we met is the visualization because drawing all the points in a database on the canvas and drawing lines between points are very difficult.
