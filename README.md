### Introduction

This is the CS225 final project repository for the group nslfcs, with members Zhuoang Tao, Qi Wu, Aoyang Li, and Jiayi Zhang. Our leading question for this project is How to get and visualize the Gnutella peer-to-peer graph/network with the most important host list. To answer this question, we decide to divide it into three parts. Firstly, we will use algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between every two vertices. Then, we will use Betweenness Centrality to measure the centrality based on the shortest paths we get in the first step and get a sorted list that contains all the vertices arranged from the most important to the least important. At last, we will visualize the graph based on the sorted list we find in the second step.

The most important thing to our project is that what we are trying to create is a "template" that can be used by any kind of graph database no matter whether the graph database is unweighted, weighted, undirected, or directed. For example, if we input the flight database or the railway database, we could get the most important airports or train stations. We could also get pictures based on those databases.

### Running Instructions

Our project use the same container as the CS225 machine problems, so you can use exactly the same way to open, build, use, and test our codes as the CS225 machine problems. Here are the detailed instructions.

1. Clown or download our project

2. Put the whole folder into CS225 folder which contains the CS225 container.

3. Open our project under the environment of the CS225 container

4. Move to the  ```Final_project``` folder with the following command

```
cd Final_project
```
5. create the ```build``` folder and move to the ```build``` folder with the following command

```
Mkdir build
cd build
```
6. run Cmake with the following command
```
cmake ..
```
7. then you can use and test our codes

We have written test suite for all of the data structures, functions, and algorithms that we implemented. We have created small,medium, and large testcases for each data structure, function, and algorithm to check their correctness and efficiency. We have also created some special testcases to test some potential side problems. So you can run our testcases by the following instructions:

1. compile the tests with the following command
```
make test
```
2. The fourth step will create an executable named test which you can execute with the following command
```
./test
```
