# CS225-Project

There are three parts in our project. Firstly, we will use algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between every two vertices. Then, we will use Betweenness Centrality to measure the centrality based on the shortest paths we get in the first step and get a sorted list which contains all the vertices arranged from the most important to the least important. At last, we will visualize the graph based on the sorted list we find in the second step.

The most important thing to our project is that we are trying to create a "template" which can be used by any kind of graph database no matter the graph database is unweighted, weighted, undirected or directed. For example, if we imput the flight database or the railway database, we could get the most important airports or train stations. We could also get pictures base on those databases.
