## Leading Question 

How to get the most important node in a given graph  (positively weighted / unweighted graph)?

How to get the shortest path between two nodes?

How to visualize a graph in 2-D plane?

## Dataset Acquisition

## Data Format

These data sets can be found here
http://snap.stanford.edu/data/p2p-Gnutella08.html

The input format of dataset should be txt., each line containing three parameters (From Node ID, To Node ID, Weight) separated by space. 

We will use all of the data. There are about 6000 nodes and 20000 edges in this graph. 

## Data Correction

If the graph is unweighted we will treat it as a weighted graph with each edge weighing 1.


## Data Storage

  We will use positively weighted graph to store data. Specifically, the whole network is stored as a graph and nodes are individual units(can be a person, a computer, or a social account).
 An estimate of total storage for betweenness centrality is at most O(n^3).


## Algorithm 


Algorithm finding the shortest path between vertices(e.g. Dijkstra's ) 
Expected input: Graph & start node
Output: Two vectors whose indexes represent nodes. The first vector stores the shortest distance and the other vector stores the previous node. 
Optimal Big O: O(nlog(n)+m)

Betweenness Centrality: to get the most important vertex in a graph 
Expected input: Graph
Output: A vector of nodes sorting by its importance in the graph
Optimal Big O: O(n^2) to O(n^3)
